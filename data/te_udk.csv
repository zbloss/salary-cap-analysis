He set career highs in red zone targets, 10-zone targets, and red zone TD receptions. With Marquise Brown vacating a 26% target share and Andrews holding down his role as the team's leading weapon near the goal line, he's got as good a chance as anyone to repeat as fantasy's top TE.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

His TE2 finish last season was still an obvious difference maker in fantasy. Ask any of your league mates - when they see Kelce in your lineup, it's terrifying. Now, he'll be playing a full season without Tyreek Hill and a bunch of unproven/role player WRs on the depth chart. Kelce could go absolutely nuclear in 2022 even at 32 years old.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

After running the third most routes run among all TEs last season, the opportunity ahead for Schultz in a good offense is massive. The Cowboys are vacating 181 WR targets AND 44% (!!) of their targets from inside the 10-yard line, giving him paths to both an increase in target share and TDs in 2022. We're extremely bullish on Schultz if you miss out on one of the top three guys this year, especially considering Michael Gallup is recovering from a late-season ACL injury.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

With the lack of available playmakers in the offense, Pitts should go over 1,000 yards again this year, but the TD upside is a concern. We're not exactly excited about the upside of an offense run by a combination of Marcus Mariota and 3rd round rookie, Desmond Ridder. That said, from an analytics standpoint, Pitts is a screaming positive regression candidate in the TD department. He saw the 4th most targets a year ago among all TEs and scored just once.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

He missed Weeks 13-17 during fantasy crunch time with a knee injury but is fully healthy to enter the season. While Waller is still one of few TEs can separate at the position, he's typically been a volume guy. Will he see that same volume with Davante Adams now on the roster? His biggest target competition in 2020 when he was the TE2 was Nelson Agholor and in 2019 when he was the TE3, it was Tyrell Williams.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Hock enters his fourth year in the NFL, which is typically when breakout seasons happen for the position. If you miss out on one of the elite TEs at the top, we don't mind taking a shot on the Hockstrap who has shown an ability to earn targets in his young career. He only played in 12 games a year ago but was on pace to earn 100+ targets for a second straight season, and that's more than you can say for a lot of TEs in the NFL.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Dallas Goedert","PHI","7","8","$7","150.0","3.3","3","For the last two years, Goedert fantasy managers have been wanting to kick Zach Ertz to the curb in hopes that he would have the TE1 role to himself. We finally saw it last year when Ertz was shipped off to Arizona, and Goedert capitalized on his opportunity. His 830 receiving yards were a career high and ranked 5th among all TEs last season, and what's most impressive about this is that he's the only TE who saw less than 75 targets to eclipse 700 receiving yards a year ago. Not surprisingly, his 2.33 yards per route run was an elite metric and ranked #1 among all TEs. Goedert is a proven pass catcher, but the addition of A.J. Brown into this lineup is going to make the target volume difficult, suggesting a regression in efficiency is likely.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Zach Ertz","ARI","13","9","$7","149.9","3.3","3","Ertz was a forgotten man in fantasy to enter the season when he was in Philly, then he was traded mid-season to the Cardinals and saw a ton of volume. From Week 7 on after he was traded, Ertz was the TE6 in fantasy land. With DeAndre Hopkins out for the first six weeks to start the year, Ertz figures to be a focal point of Arizona's passing attack yet again after the team signed him to a 3-year extension this off-season.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Cole Kmet","CHI","14","10","$5","144.1","3.3","3","Jimmy Grandpa and his bedpan are finally in a retirement home, which should open up some scoring opportunities for Cole Kmet in the red zone. A year ago, 25 TEs saw at least 50 targets. Kmet is the only one who didn't score a single TD, making him an obvious positive regression candidate...that is, assuming the Bears can actually get into the red zone this year. He feels like one of those guys you can talk yourself into later in your draft, especially when you consider this team's WR2 is Byron Pringle (don't laugh), but the reality is, the floor is probably lower than it may seem on what projects to be a bad Bears offense.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Dawson Knox","BUF","7","11","$5","141.3","3.3","3","Prior to 2021, the Bills' offense barely featured the TE position, but that should change after Knox proved to be a top pass catcher at the position, especially near the goal line. Knox's 2021 season is eerily similar to that of Robert Tonyan from 2020. Knox caught just 49 passes a season ago. Nine of them were for a TD, which is basically what led to his breakout season. To put this in perspective, Knox caught a TD pass on 18% of his receptions, which is highly unlikely to be repeated, even in the Bills high-powered offense. Unless we see more volume for Knox, he could disappoint relative to his TE8 finish a year ago.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

With Eric Ebron on the roster last year, the MUTH didn't turn into an every down player until the back half of the year, but now Ebron is out of the way, and we expect Freiuermuth's route rate to increase quite a bit this season. It's encouraging how Pittsburgh used him last year. His nine targets inside the 10-zone tied for 2nd most at the position. The big stain on his 2022 outlook is playing with a rookie QB. This offense could be nerfed for at least a year as Kenny Pickett adjusts to life in the NFL.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

It's a run-first team, Drew Lock or Geno Smith will be under center, and he's competing with DK Metcalf and Tyler Lockett for targets. It feels like a lot has to go right for Fant to break into the top 8 at the position. We'll take the under.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Tyler Conklin is in New York and while that may seem super appetizing for Irv's fantasy outlook, we need to remember that Kirk Cousins' TE hasn't seen a 15+% target share since Jordan Reed did it in 2015. We like Irv as a back-end TE1 this year, but we know that isn't necessarily a difference maker at the position.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.
