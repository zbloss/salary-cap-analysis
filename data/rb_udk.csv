"Christian McCaffrey","CAR","13","1","$62","315.5","6.8","1","The pain and drama that fantasy managers have felt over the last two years is nothing short of Oscar-worthy. When he's on the field, he's the elite of the elite finishing as a top-6 RB in seven of his ten starts the last two years. But the headline is the fact he's played in just 31 percent of his games the last two years. If you can't move past the emotional baggage, we get it. But facing a healthy CMC is like facing two players at the same time. We still view him as a difference-maker in an elite RB1 tier with only Jonathan Taylor in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Jonathan Taylor","IND","14","2","$72","313.8","1.3","1","JTT! Yes, he was a 90’s heartthrob turned NFL RB and he certainly turned up the heat in 2021. How dominant was JTT? From Weeks 4-15, he had 11 RB1 performances in a row! To compare, Todd Gurley‘s great 2018 (10 straight) and Christian McCaffrey‘s 2019 (9 straight) fell short. He’s one of five RBs in NFL history to go for 1,800 & 18 TDs. To keep this historical train rolling, he had 89(!) red-zone rushing attempts, most of all time. The next closest in 2021: Austin Ekeler at 49! The even crazier thing is he could’ve had even more TDs… 18 different drives where he was tackled on a rushing play inside the five-yard line and didn’t end up scoring on that drive. If you want to lock in 10+ rushing TDs at the 1.01, he makes sense there for 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Austin Ekeler","LAC","8","3","$53","276.7","4.0","2","There were some concerns heading into the season about Ekeler not being a big TD guy and whether he could handle a big workload. After coming on the podcast in the summer, there was some doubt although Ekeler was almost one of Jason’s “My Guys”. After 300 opportunities, it’s clear he was a league winner as one of seven RBs in league history with 20 TDs & 70 receptions in the same season. He had arguably one of the best red-zone seasons of all-time scoring all 20 of his TDs there. He averaged 10 fantasy points per game inside the 20. That’s the 2nd most over the last decade with Todd Gurley (2018) averaging 11.3 in his monster season. There is some debate if fantasy managers will be able to appreciate Ekeler enough to make him a top-3 pick as part of an exciting Chargers offense. He’s deserving of it, especially in PPR leagues.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

He had six RB1 performances in a row including three No. 1 overall finishes. He was on a ridiculous 464 carry pace through Week 7 before suffering a Jones fracture. Somehow Henry still finished the year 3rd in evaded tackles despite playing only eight games. He is not from this planet. He returned in the Titans' playoff loss seeing 20 carries and after an off-season of resting his foot, he should be good to go for 2022. Henry is the centerpiece, the fuel, and heart of the Titans offense and still worth a top-5 pick in redraft.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He totaled the 3rd most carries, 5th most red-zone touches, and the 4th most TDs among all RBs. But he became a stalwart in the middle of the season. From Weeks 6-12, he had 23+ fantasy points in 5-of-6 weeks! With the Bengals' offense ready to roll with its young nucleus, it’s clear Mixon is an easy 1st round pick in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

The usage is incredible as he saw the 5th most carries and finished with the 2nd most 15+ yard runs in the NFL. However, the big stain on his 2021 campaign was averaging a rushing TD once every 41.5 carries, a massive dip from the 19.4 he averaged over the previous two seasons. He should bounce back to double-digits in 2022 and the Vikings offense is one we are bullish on overall. Cook comes at a relative discount from his previous years but we still view him as an RB1 in the first round of your draft.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Alvin Kamara","NO","14","7","$46","251.1","3.5","2","We didn’t quite get the Super Kamario of old in 2022. Apart from missing Weeks 10-13, he dealt with having three different QBs (four if you count that one Ian Book game) and an offensive line that faced a ton of injuries. New Orleans started 13(!) different offensive linemen on the year. Kamara still averaged 22 touches per game, led all RBs in target share (20%), and saw the 5th most red-zone touches. However, he totaled only four rushing TDs, very “unKamarian” to say the least. Since 2010, Kamara tied for 2nd fewest rushing TDs (4) among RBs with 240+ carries in a season. In that sample size of 125 RBs… TD expectation for 240+ carries was 8.8 rush TDs. With his legal situation up in the air, Kamara could face up to a six-game suspension. Until details clear up further, he's a major risk/reward pick in the 2nd round.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Najee Harris","PIT","9","8","$42","239.2","3.7","3","Harris’ greatness might’ve flown under the radar. He’s one of 11 RBs in NFL history with 300+ carries & 90+ targets in a season. He led the league in touches as a rookie which only four RBs (Eric Dickerson, Edgerrin James, LaDainian Tomlinson & Najee) have done in league history. Some of the inefficiency might come to the surface in complaints but an offense led by Big Ben and the Steelers' offensive line wasn’t helpful. Harris had the 2nd lowest yards per carry (3.91) ever among rookie RBs with 1,200+ rushing yards. The lowest? The aforementioned LaDainian Tomlinson at 3.65. He was fine and Najee will be too moving forward. The opportunity was glorious but there are a few red flags heading into 2022. The team talked about easing his workload to ensure health and production. A new QB also brings an added variable as we have no idea how Mitchell Trubisky or Kenny Pickett will handle this offense. He's still an RB1 in our book but more of a mid-second-round player given the risks. We can't simply copy and paste last year's number for Harris.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Leonard Fournette","TB","11","9","$41","236.4","3.3","3","Fournette was a fantasy savior for many who needed to plug their RB spot in the middle of the year. From Weeks 4-15, he was the RB3. His pace during that span was 349 opportunities (including 88 receptions). The passing work is what helped boost him averaging five receptions per game on the season. He’s still only 27 years old so Fournette proved he still has some good football left. He's a low-end RB1 but you likely won't have to pay that type of premium price in your draft.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Ezekiel Elliott","DAL","9","10","$40","235.7","4.3","3","Towards the end of the year, the prevailing narrative surrounding Zeke was that he was old and busted. While the Dallas offensive line was still elite, Elliott struggled to hit the century mark rushing the ball. It wasn’t for a lack of playing time as he ran the 2nd most routes of all RBs. He still was solid and in a season with lots of injuries at the RB position, he felt more like a low-end RB1 than someone who finished at RB6. His contract is an albatross so he’ll be right back to being the dude in Dallas in 2022. The old Zeke is gone but he could end up being a value as an RB2 slipping past the third round in drafts.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"D'Andre Swift","DET","6","11","$40","235.4","4.3","3","Swift might be top-5 in the NFL in terms of pure RB talent. In 2021, he had the most yards created per touch among RBs and started the year as a fantasy difference-maker as the RB7 through Week 11. But he's had the injury bug bite him each of his first two seasons and Jamaal Williams is annoyingly still around. Swift's calling card is being one of the best pass-catchers at the position. He's one of seven RBs over the last decade with 100+ receptions and 15 TDs in their first two years. The talent and opportunity are there for him to put it fully together as an elite RB1 this year. He's a 2nd round redraft pick with the biggest risk being taking a Lions RB this early and living to tell the tale.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Apart from TDs, he had several other solid overall metrics including his most forced missed tackles (40) of his career. Conner is only 26 years old and should see an every-down role in 2022. He is a borderline 1st/2nd round pick with the type of usage he saw.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

While he finished out the fantasy season on a high note, he busted more than you would want (27% of the time) for an RB1. A.J. Dillon clearly has emerged as a valuable part of this offense but there is a world where both can coexist for fantasy. The Packers have the 5th most vacated targets in the NFL and our research shows often the RB position is the one that benefits the most when there is turnover. He's a relative value at the beginning of the 3rd round in drafts and someone we are high on while fantasy managers might be souring.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He's the diet cola version of Derrick Henry, which is a massive compliment. Since coming into the league in 2018, Chubb trails only Henry in total rushing yards and finished as an RB1 each of the last three years. However, you know you're not getting much in the passing game averaging just 24 receptions per year. The Cleveland offense could be exciting with Deshaun Watson under center but his looming suspension brings an added risk to start the season.

We were ready to crown Williams a top-10 back with upside to finish inside the top-3 at the position. Regardless, his rookie year was super encouraging with over 1,200+ yards from scrimmage and more than 50 targets. He was a force with the ball in his hands with the 6th most forced missed tackles among RBs. The Denver offense should be one to buy into across the board with Russell Wilson behind center. He's now more of a solid RB2 with Gordon around but everything in his profile says a breakout is coming.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

The Giants' offense was a laughingstock by the end of the year as the team hit their Vegas team implied total only five times all year. After returning from his injury and the Week 10 bye, Barkley averaged 3.7 yards per carry, scored one TD, and finished inside the top-20 among RBs just once. It was painful to watch if you had high hopes at the beginning of the season. He's now sunk so far down in the minds of fantasy managers that he becomes a potential value in 2022.

His usage was elite seeing 86 percent of the RB rush attempts and 74 percent of the RB targets from Week 9 on. While the offense in Chicago projects as one of the least efficient in the league, his pace when he returned from injury last year was 374 opportunities. You can't find that type of workload too often this late in your draft. He's a perfect RB2 for your roster.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

He saw the 5th most RB receptions after the Raiders finally came to their senses and nine rushing TDs on the ground. RB15 is nothing to shy away from but realize Kenyan Drake also missed half the season with an ankle injury. After the new coaching regime and management did not exercise his 5th-year option, Jacobs could be in his last year in the silver and black. Over the last three years, only Dalvin Cook has more red-zone rushing attempts than Jacobs so you're banking on 8+ rushing TDs on the ground. Consider him in the RB15-20 range which is a valuable asset in fantasy but the ceiling likely isn't much higher.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

We've seen at least two rookie RBs finish inside the top-24 each of the last seven years and Hall has the best shot to be part of that group in 2022.

However, he ran out of gas in the final month (RB56, 31, 37, 70) which raises some questions heading into 2022. He scored more points as a receiver than as a rusher making him an odd RB to project moving forward.

However, the second half was a different story. From Week 10 on, he was the RB4. Some of this success was due to the absence of J.D. McKissic, who was concussed in Week 12 and did not return for the rest of the season. From that point on, Gibson saw five targets per game. Overall, he still tied with Joe Mixon for 2nd most 1st downs among all RBs. But the TDs were the major story. In 2020, he had a TD every 15 carries; in 2021, that regressed to every 37 carries.

With more than a year removed from the injury, Akers is getting hyped as a potential RB1 in fantasy this year. We aren't as bullish on his prospects tempering our expectations more in the low-end RB2 range.

He ended up leading the league in yards per carry (6.3) and running for 700+ in his final six games. It was the stuff of fantasy legends and the Seahawks decided to bring him back on a one-year deal.
