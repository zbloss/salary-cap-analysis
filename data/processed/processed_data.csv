1,Justin Herbert,LAC,2,35,357.9,0.03333333333333334,2,"Herbert finished the year on a tear with eight straight top-12 weeks in a row. He’s currently on a Hall of Fame trajectory: with the most completions (839), attempts (1267), passing yards (9,350), and passing TDs (69) through a QB’s first two years in the NFL.  Here are the players to throw for 5,000+ in a season before turning 24: Patrick Mahomes, Dan Marino, Matthew Stafford, & Herbert. The offensive line was massively improved and HC Brandon Staley is everything we want choosing aggressiveness on 4th down instead of simply punting things away.",QB,10.226,0.341
2,Kyler Murray,ARI,3,29,350.0,0.36666666666666664,2,"In 2021, Kyler started out hot as the Cardinals began the season 7-0 and he looked like a legit MVP candidate. He was the QB4 for fantasy through that span. However, the season turned on a dime, especially with Kyler missing three games and the season-ending injury to All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins. He was effective throwing the deep ball, tying Tom Brady for most 20+ yard completions (35), and completing a league-leading 49.3 of those attempts. He improved his overall completion rate, TD rate, yards per attempt, and passing yards per game but dropped to fewer than FIVE rushing attempts per game. If Kyler doesn’t run, his fantasy ceiling ultimately is capped. Heading into 2022, the Cardinals have a ton of question marks with Hopkins’ suspension so he might fall to a spot in your drafts where the value is there.",QB,12.069,4.425
3,Jalen Hurts,PHI,4,30,348.0,0.14444444444444443,2,"Hurts was among the most consistent fantasy QBs in 2021. He delivered 11 QB1 finishes despite only 16 total passing TDs. Much of that was thanks to leading all QBs in rushing yards (784) and rushing TDs (10). Hurts averaged 8.43 rushing fantasy points per game in his 15 starts.  If you include his four starts in 2020, that number jumps to 8.82. For context, through his 49 career starts, Lamar Jackson is at 8.6. With the arrival of A.J. Brown and DeVonta Smith in year 2, Hurts can take the next step forward as a capable passer translating to top-5 upside in fantasy.",QB,11.6,1.676
4,Patrick Mahomes,KC,5,29,344.1,0.14444444444444443,2,"It didn’t exactly feel like a top-5 QB season for Mahomes in 2021. You felt the ups and downs especially a stretch in the middle of the season where he was the QB18 from Weeks 7 to 12. Before then, he was on fire to start the year as the QB1 through Week 7 including 25+ fantasy points in five of his first six starts. The Chiefs’ defensive improvement was a big part of the story as KC allowed only 16.1 points per game from Week 8 on. He still was a QB1 each of the final five weeks of the season. He’s still among the elite for 2022 despite Tyreek Hill’s departure and Travis Kelce being a year older.",QB,11.866,1.714
5,Lamar Jackson,BAL,6,27,339.6,0.2222222222222222,3,"The Ravens suffered a litany of injuries across the board including Lamar missing the final five weeks of the season. He averaged the most passing attempts per game (31.8) of his career and he was on pace for nearly 1,100 rushing yards. This team is built around Lamar’s strength and with a schedule that definitely eases up in 2022, the Ravens should return to their former playoff selves. He is still an elite option although it’s possible he slips into the 5th/6th rounds in 2022 where we are happy to scoop him up as a difference-maker.",QB,12.578,2.795
6,Tom Brady,TB,7,25,330.5,0.1111111111111111,3,"At the ripe age of 44, Brady was the most consistent fantasy QB of 2021. He led the league in completions, attempts, passing yards (5316), and passing TDs (43). Not bad for an old-timer. He also came out of the gate on fire as a top-5 QB in six of 1st eight starts. The Tampa Bay offensive line is elite with Brady sporting the lowest sack rate in the NFL. There’s little reason to doubt him going into 2022. Oh, and he’s now got the personality and social media game to want to root for him even if he’s wounded your favorite NFL team in the past.",QB,13.22,1.469
7,Russell Wilson,DEN,8,22,326.5,0.30000000000000004,4,"In a new uniform with a new set of weapons, Wilson’s exodus from Seattle to Denver hopefully is a breath of fresh air and an opportunity for Mr. Unlimited to truly do as much cooking as he wants. He’s been a QB1 for fantasy every year of his career before last season’s injury. He’s an efficiency monster with a career TD rate of 6.2 percent. 35 passing TDs and 300+ rushing yards feel well within range even at this stage of his career. He’s safe but the ceiling is there to finish inside the top-5 at the position.",QB,14.841,4.452
8,Joe Burrow,CIN,9,20,320.2,0.25555555555555554,4,"Burrow’s final two weeks were the stuff of legends.  His Week 16 & 17 performances: 971 yards and eight TDs combined. To put those numbers in perspective, Tom Brady never had more than one game in a season hitting 400 & 4. Burrow did it in back-to-back games. In just his 2nd year in the league, he led the NFL in completion % (70.4), Yards per Pass Attempt (8.9) & 20+ Yard TDs (13). If there were any red flags, it’s the fact he led the NFL in sacks taken (51) including five games of 5+ sacks taken, most in a season over the last decade. He also bullied bottom-16 defenses with the largest split of fantasy points  (11.28) among top-10 QBs. While a TD rate more than doubling (3.2 to 6.5) usually is a sign of regression, he might be an outlier. His upside is immense as 5,000 passing yards & 40 TDs aren’t out of the question.",QB,16.01,4.091
9,Trey Lance,SF,10,17,312.9,0.7,4,"The public is split on Lance: is it a full go for him to take the reins of this Kyle Shanahan offense or is Jimmy Garoppolo sticking around because Lance simply isn't ready. Including this year's draft class, Lance would still be the youngest starting QB in the league at 22 years old. We only saw him in two brief starts but he managed to run the ball 24 combined times for 120 rushing yards which just shows you the type of upside you're looking for. He's worth a look as a late-round QB knowing you can pivot if things turn out horribly wrong with him under center. The reward outweighs the risk at his current ADP.",QB,18.406,12.884
10,Dak Prescott,DAL,11,17,309.6,0.25555555555555554,4,"Dak had some monster games in 2021 returning from a major injury with a 38 percent ‘great game rate’, he trailed only Josh Allen and Tom Brady among top-10 QBs. With the highest completion rate (69%) and TD rate (6.2%) of his career, he bounced back nicely. Dallas led NFL in points per game (31.2)  including seven games of 35+ points. He hit a lull from Weeks 13-15 but finished strong in the final three weeks:  QB2, QB5, and QB1. He’s one of the safest QBs in fantasy and the Dallas offense (with OC Kellen Moore) is going to flow through the arm of Dak. If he runs for 200+ and scores 4-5 on the ground, Dak could enter the elite tier again in 2022.",QB,18.212,4.654
11,Matthew Stafford,LAR,12,15,300.1,0.14444444444444443,5,"Stafford’s top-5 finish feels a bit flawed when you consider some of the major flops (MIN & BAL) he had towards the end of the year for fantasy managers. Nevertheless, he led the league in games of 3+ TD passes (9) and his ten top-12 performances were the same as Aaron Rodgers. The frustrating part was the turnovers. He joins Drew Brees (2012) as the only QBs in NFL history to throw for 40+ TDs & lead the league in INTs. He also led the league with four pick-sixes. Stafford will likely be drafted among the top-8 QBs for 2022; with Cooper Kupp in tow and Allen Robinson’s arrival, he should have more options inside the red zone.",QB,20.007,2.89
12,Kirk Cousins,MIN,13,14,299.9,0.1888888888888889,5,"Cousins is one of the steadiest fantasy QBs out there. It's not flashy but over the past three years, he has a 6.2 percent TD rate, the fifth-highest in the NFL. In 2021, he had nine QB1 performances and one of the better road splits in football averaging 23 fantasy points per contest. Jason is especially bullish on the Vikings' passing game this year making Cousins one of the preferred late-round QBs to open the season.",QB,21.421,4.046
13,Aaron Rodgers,GB,14,12,293.3,0.36666666666666664,5,"The back-to-back league MVP finished the year on a roll. From Weeks 11-17, here were his fantasy finishes: QB2, 2, bye, 3, 6, 8, 9. Not bad when you consider how the Packers started the year getting annihilated against the Saints in Week 1. Two TDs were in the bank almost every single week as Rodgers had two or more passing TDs in 15 of his 17 starts. There are obviously lots of questions heading in 2022 with Davante Adams’ departure. His floor is high but a top-3 finish likely isn’t in the range of outcomes given his lack of rushing upside at this stage of his career.",QB,24.442,8.962
14,Derek Carr,LV,15,6,274.0,0.2222222222222222,5,"You have to feel happy for Derek Carr getting a massive extension and reuniting with his best bud Davante Adams. No word yet on how close they are and if breakfast is in their summer plans. It’s a definite boom for Carr’s upside but it must be tempered knowing he’s never finished a season as a top-12 fantasy QB. Even with 4,800+ passing yards and finishing 2nd among all QBs in 20+ yard pass plays last season, his lack of rushing yards ultimately hurts him from hanging with the elites for fantasy. The Raiders also were quite fortunate in 2021 going 10-7 despite having a win expectation of just 6.9. In the ultra-competitive AFC West, things only might get tougher in 2022. Carr is a QB2 that will have weeks against sub-par opponents.",QB,45.667,10.148
15,Daniel Jones,NYG,16,2,261.3,0.7444444444444445,6,"It feels like we’ve been here before as this now marks the 4th year of your precious life where Daniel Jones is the starting QB for the New York Giants. I know, your brain won’t let you forget nor can you unsee what has transpired on the football field as his teams have gone a combined 12-25 thus far. It seems like we know what he is: wildly erratic with the occasional boom games thanks to his sneaky rushing floor averaging 26.3 rushing yards per game. More than anything, we know that former Giants GM Dave Gettleman reached for Jones at 6th overall in the 2019 draft and the Giants look like they’re moving on not picking up his 5th-year option. Dependability isn’t one of his key traits; rather, it’s volatility and fumbling.",QB,130.65,97.262
16,Tua Tagovailoa,MIA,17,2,259.7,0.4444444444444444,6,"This is his time… at least Miami fans are saying that. The Dolphins front office has done everything imaginable to equip Tua bringing in an offensive-minded head coach, trading for Tyreek Hill, and signing LT Terron Armstead to bolster the league’s worst offensive line. Unfortunately, we’ve seen relatively few true boom games from Tua with only two top-8 weekly finishes in his first two years in the league. While the Dolphins had the 8th most pass attempts in the NFL, the lack of efficiency and averaging only 204 passing yards per game is not going to cut it. His career TD rate of 4.1 percent will need to climb dramatically for him to finish inside the top-12 at the position.",QB,129.85,57.711
17,Trevor Lawrence,JAX,18,1,258.5,0.5444444444444445,6,"How bad was it in Jacksonville? Lawrence's 12 passing TDs & 214.2 passing yards per game were the lowest ever for any QB with 600+ passing attempts in a season.  Among rookie QBs to start at least 12 games in a season, his 2% TD rate is the lowest ever. But it's actually quite sane to point at Urban Meyer as the pile of dog poo and blame the circle of flies hovering around Lawrence's fantasy outlook along with it. The Jaguars are pressing reset adding WR Christian Kirk to a unit that underwhelmed in 2021. Lawrence can only go up from here, right? A top-12 season is well within the realm of possibilities but top-15 would be a step in the right direction.",QB,258.5,140.739
18,Mac Jones,NE,19,1,254.6,0.2222222222222222,7,"Jones exceeded almost everyone’s expectations in 2021 leading the Patriots to a 10-7 record and a playoff appearance. He finished 8th in completion percentage at 67.6, the 2nd highest number for a rookie all-time behind only Dak Prescott (67.7). For fantasy, it’s kind of like Bill Belichick treats him like a Honda Civic. Dependable? Yes. Are you ever going to win a street race? No, unless it’s totally tricked out. The Patriots' game plan is winning with ball control and defense as Jones averaged only 223.6 passing yards per game finishing as a QB1 only five times. Four of the five came at home against bottom-16 defenses so if you do want to stream the 2nd year QB, make sure it’s a matchup-based decision.",QB,254.6,56.578
19,Matt Ryan,IND,20,1,254.2,0.1888888888888889,7,"Ryan gets a fresh start in Indianapolis after being Atlanta's franchise QB since 2008, way back when George Dubbya was president. The Colts are currently divisional favorites and after stumbling down the stretch with Carson Wentz last year, Ryan hopefully can return better than replacement level play. He's a long way away from being the 4,500+ yardage machine he was for years in Atlanta. Jonathan Taylor is the center of this offense and while Ryan will have his moments, the lack of proven playmakers outside of Michael Pittman Jr. puts him in mid-QB2 territory rather than a viable fantasy starter out the gate.",QB,254.2,48.016
20,Justin Fields,CHI,21,1,251.3,0.7555555555555555,7,"There are major mixed opinions amongst the Footballers about Fields' 2022 outlook. The upside? He is one of six rookie QBs since 2010 to average 35 rushing yards per game and we saw glimpses of his greatness including a monster game in Week 8 versus San Francisco. The fears are this Bears team could be among the worst in the NFL and if you can name more than two pass catchers for this team, congratulations. The receivers apart from Darnell Mooney are below replacement level and the Bears did little this off-season to outfit Fields for success. You either gamble on his talent as a late-round QB based on what you saw briefly with your eyeballs or stay far away in drafts based on what your heart knows is true about these 2022 Chicago Bears. Whispers: it is not good.",QB,251.3,189.871
21,Jameis Winston,NO,22,1,247.9,0.4444444444444444,7,The Saints were a respectable 5-2 with Jameis before he went down to a season-ending knee injury. He likely won't be fully ready at the start of the season but the former No. 1 pick is still only 28 years old. We’re past the Tampa Bay days of Jameis wildly throwing TDs & INTs like his life depended on it. This version seems to have his foot hovering over the break as the Saints' defense is one of the better units in the league.,QB,247.9,110.178
22,Ryan Tannehill,TEN,23,1,246.8,0.5555555555555556,7,"After receiving a massive contract extension the previous offseason, Tannehill and the Titans fought their way through major team injuries across the board to finish as the AFC's No. 1 seed. For fantasy, Tannehill was basically not startable despite finishing as QB12. His TD rate returned back to earth at a pedestrian 4 percent after being at 6.9 the previous three seasons. With A.J. Brown gone, it's hard envisioning Tannehill being able to repeat his previous peak fantasy powers again in 2022. He's not a volume passer and unless you think Treylon Burks is already elite, Tannehill is best kept as a QB2. He will have streaming weeks but this offense functions through Derrick Henry.",QB,246.8,137.111
23,Carson Wentz,WAS,24,1,244.1,0.5555555555555556,7,"Wentz’s season was a complete roller coaster with the Colts starting out 1-4 before the team caught fire. From Weeks 5-12, he was the QB7 and it seemed like he fixed some of his wayward decisions. He lowered his INT rate to 1.4% but a career low 210 passing yards per game. After their embarrassing Week 18 defeat to the Jaguars knocked them out of the playoffs, GM Chris Ballard publicly shared that the team was done with Wentz and his antics. In Washington, Wentz is now on his 3rd life with a new cast of pass-catchers. One drive he can look like an All-Pro and the next you’re wondering if maybe he knows which sport he’s playing out there. There is no chance you can have confidence in Wentz’s week-to-week outlook for fantasy but the fact Washington believes he’s an upgrade over what they trotted out there last year is at least somewhat encouraging. I think.",QB,244.1,135.611
24,Mitch Trubisky,PIT,25,1,243.8,0.7,7,Pittsburgh will name their starting QB but the time is ticking for Trubisky to eventually be supplanted by rookie Kenny Pickett at some point in the year. Maybe it's best to forget the fact Chicago once traded up to No. 2 overall to pick this guy... ahead of Patrick Mahomes? Sigh.,QB,243.8,170.66
25,Jared Goff,DET,26,1,241.2,0.25555555555555554,8,Goff and the Lions played hard for Dan Campbell last year. The problem is grit and biting kneecaps doesn't exactly translate to fantasy production.  He had three weeks inside the top-12 at the position and finished with his lowest yards per attempt (6.8) of his career. The arrival of rookie Jameson Williams gives Lions fans some optimism for exciting down-the-field plays but Goff's main targets will be Amon-Ra St. Brown and T.J. Hockenson over the middle. The Lions could surprise this year but Goff is best left off fantasy rosters.,QB,241.2,61.64
26,Zach Wilson,NYJ,27,1,239.5,0.6333333333333333,8,"Wilson is getting a pass for his otherwise rough rookie year. He completed just 55(!) percent of his passes and led all QBs in sacks where the “QB was responsible”, not the offensive line. At the end of the year, he did show some flashes of brilliance including some rushing prowess which definitely entices fantasy managers. The Jets had a great NFL draft including taking Garrett Wilson at 10th overall to pair with Elijah Moore as one of the best young pass-catching duos in the NFL. Wilson has the tools but there are still major questions about whether he can take the leap for fantasy and be consistent enough to count on. Streamer? Yes. Will he turn into a weekly starter? Likely no.",QB,239.5,151.683

In Carolina, he has one more shot to cash in on his potential heading into a contract year. He's an obvious upgrade over Sam Darnold on an offense that has some solid offensive weapons that just need more competent play. The Panthers ranked 29th in points per game, 31st in passing TDs, and dead last in yards per play. He's off the redraft radar to start the year although CAR playing CLE in Week 1 is enticing for a revenge game narrative.",QB,231.9,121.103
28,Marcus Mariota,ATL,29,1,230.6,0.7444444444444445,8,"Mariota signed a two-year deal with Atlanta to be a bridge QB to potentially Desmond Ridder, whom Atlanta took in the 3rd round. Mariota has a ton of familiarity with Arthur Smith's system and could have some sneaky SuperFlex appeal if they let him run 5+ times a game. Nevertheless, Atlanta is arguably the worst team in the league and at this stage in his career, Mariota is a journeyman with a below-average arm.",QB,230.6,171.669

Geno was competent from a game manager standpoint last year; but for fantasy, you might as well prepare your body for full-on diarrhea. In three starts, he averaged just 26 pass attempts per game with passing yard totals so maddeningly low (209, 167, & 195) that they will make you want to voluntarily sign up for a timeshare. The passing options in Seattle will suffer and you will too if you disregard pure logic, sear your conscience, and damage your soul forever drafting Geno.",QB,227.6,177.022
30,Davis Mills,HOU,31,1,212.4,0.41111111111111115,8,"The General surprised most of the NFL (and fantasy managers) with competent QB play for arguably one of the worst teams. In his 11 starts, Mills had four weeks as a top-12 QB against four tough defenses: NE, LAR, LAC & TEN. He also surprisingly had one of the better deep balls with the highest Passer Rating (123.5) on 20+ yard attempts among all QBs.  The weapons (especially at RB) are certainly less than stellar but Mills could have some weeks as a streamer. Just don’t expect the Texans to win more than 4-5 games this year.",QB,212.4,87.32

Apart from landing on a brand new team, his legal troubles could suspend him for a lengthy amount of time. We haven't seen him take an NFL snap in a couple of years but he was the QB5 three consecutive seasons in a row from 2018 to 2020. You know his upside as a runner averaging 450+ rushing yards and five rushing TDs per season. In terms of drafting, until we know how his legal situation plays out, Watson is off draft boards as sportsbooks currently aren't laying a line for Cleveland's win total.",QB,175.3,126.606

The hometown QB stays home to rescue the pro team from the flaming hot garbage their aging QB put out there last year. Yes, Ben Roethlisberger looked like a washed-up guy in 2021 and now it seems Pickett will eventually take over the reins as Mike Tomlin's preferred starting QB. Pickett had monster production in his last year at Pitt with 42 passing TDs to only seven INTs. Mitchell Trubisky likely will begin the season as the veteran bridge QB so Pickett should be best left on your waiver wire to start the year.",QB,126.1,91.072

He technically started five games for Miami last year while Tua Tagovailoa was hurt but they were putrid performances, to say the least. He's benefitted from being at the right place at the right time with Andrew Luck's injury (2017), Luck's retirement (2019), and now Watson's situation. Who knows how many games he will start but he is firmly off the redraft radar with a career completion rate (60%) and TD rate (3.2) that are vomit-worthy.",QB,109.1,42.428

When he's on the field, he's the elite of the elite finishing as a top-6 RB in seven of his ten starts the last two years. But the headline is the fact he's played in just 31 percent of his games the last two years. If you can't move past the emotional baggage, we get it. But facing a healthy CMC is like facing two players at the same time. We still view him as a difference-maker in an elite RB1 tier with only Jonathan Taylor in 2022.",RB,5.089,3.28

After coming on the podcast in the summer, there was some doubt although Ekeler was almost one of Jason’s “My Guys”. After 300 opportunities, it’s clear he was a league winner as one of seven RBs in league history with 20 TDs & 70 receptions in the same season. He had arguably one of the best red-zone seasons of all-time scoring all 20 of his TDs there. He averaged 10 fantasy points per game inside the 20. That’s the 2nd most over the last decade with Todd Gurley (2018) averaging 11.3 in his monster season. There is some debate if fantasy managers will be able to appreciate Ekeler enough to make him a top-3 pick as part of an exciting Chargers offense.

The usage is incredible as he saw the 5th most carries and finished with the 2nd most 15+ yard runs in the NFL. However, the big stain on his 2021 campaign was averaging a rushing TD once every 41.5 carries, a massive dip from the 19.4 he averaged over the previous two seasons. He should bounce back to double-digits in 2022 and the Vikings offense is one we are bullish on overall. Cook comes at a relative discount from his previous years but we still view him as an RB1 in the first round of your draft.",RB,5.36,1.191

New Orleans started 13(!) different offensive linemen on the year. Kamara still averaged 22 touches per game, led all RBs in target share (20%), and saw the 5th most red-zone touches. However, he totaled only four rushing TDs, very “unKamarian” to say the least. Since 2010, Kamara tied for 2nd fewest rushing TDs (4) among RBs with 240+ carries in a season. In that sample size of 125 RBs… TD expectation for 240+ carries was 8.8 rush TDs. With his legal situation up in the air, Kamara could face up to a six-game suspension.

43,Ezekiel Elliott,DAL,10,40,235.7,0.36666666666666664,3,"Towards the end of the year, the prevailing narrative surrounding Zeke was that he was old and busted. While the Dallas offensive line was still elite, Elliott struggled to hit the century mark rushing the ball. It wasn’t for a lack of playing time as he ran the 2nd most routes of all RBs. He still was solid and in a season with lots of injuries at the RB position, he felt more like a low-end RB1 than someone who finished at RB6. His contract is an albatross so he’ll be right back to being the dude in Dallas in 2022. The old Zeke is gone but he could end up being a value as an RB2 slipping past the third round in drafts.",RB,5.892,2.16
46,Aaron Jones,GB,13,42,234.4,0.1888888888888889,3,"Jones finished barely inside the top-12 on the back of the 6th most RB receptions and the 9th most red-zone touches. While he finished out the fantasy season on a high note, he busted more than you would want (27% of the time) for an RB1. A.J. Dillon clearly has emerged as a valuable part of this offense but there is a world where both can coexist for fantasy. The Packers have the 5th most vacated targets in the NFL and our research shows often the RB position is the one that benefits the most when there is turnover. He's a relative value at the beginning of the 3rd round in drafts and someone we are high on while fantasy managers might be souring.",RB,5.581,1.054
47,Nick Chubb,CLE,14,37,222.1,0.25555555555555554,3,"At this point in his career, we know what Chubb brings to the table: monster rushing totals and one of the best tackle breakers in the NFL. He's the diet cola version of Derrick Henry, which is a massive compliment. Since coming into the league in 2018, Chubb trails only Henry in total rushing yards and finished as an RB1 each of the last three years. However, you know you're not getting much in the passing game averaging just 24 receptions per year. The Cleveland offense could be exciting with Deshaun Watson under center but his looming suspension brings an added risk to start the season. Chubb is a fringe RB1 with more boom/bust weeks than you might like.",RB,6.003,1.534
48,Javonte Williams,DEN,15,36,219.5,0.25555555555555554,4,"The tickets for the Javonte hype train were mailed and people were waiting at the train station ready to hop aboard before the Broncos re-signed Melvin Gordon late in the free-agency period. We were ready to crown Williams a top-10 back with upside to finish inside the top-3 at the position. Regardless, his rookie year was super encouraging with over 1,200+ yards from scrimmage and more than 50 targets. He was a force with the ball in his hands with the 6th most forced missed tackles among RBs. The Denver offense should be one to buy into across the board with Russell Wilson behind center. He's now more of a solid RB2 with Gordon around but everything in his profile says a breakout is coming.",RB,6.097,1.558
49,Saquon Barkley,NYG,16,35,219.3,0.4444444444444444,4,"It's Saquon's 5th year in the league but it feels like it's been eons since we've last seen this superhuman fully on the field. The Giants' offense was a laughingstock by the end of the year as the team hit their Vegas team implied total only five times all year. After returning from his injury and the Week 10 bye, Barkley averaged 3.7 yards per carry, scored one TD, and finished inside the top-20 among RBs just once. It was painful to watch if you had high hopes at the beginning of the season. He's now sunk so far down in the minds of fantasy managers that he becomes a potential value in 2022. You could do a lot worse than finding an RB2 in the third round.",RB,6.266,2.785
50,David Montgomery,CHI,17,31,203.2,0.30000000000000004,4,"Montgomery once again was a league-winner in fantasy as the RB2 from Week 13 through the fantasy playoffs. It's now back-to-back years that he's come on in the second half. The Bears seem willing to make him the only show in town at RB. His usage was elite seeing 86 percent of the RB rush attempts and 74 percent of the RB targets from Week 9 on. While the offense in Chicago projects as one of the least efficient in the league, his pace when he returned from injury last year was 374 opportunities. You can't find that type of workload too often this late in your draft. He's a perfect RB2 for your roster.",RB,6.555,1.967
51,Josh Jacobs,LV,18,30,202.4,0.36666666666666664,5,"Jacobs gave fantasy managers about as solid an RB2 season as you could ask for. He saw the 5th most RB receptions after the Raiders finally came to their senses and nine rushing TDs on the ground. RB15 is nothing to shy away from but realize Kenyan Drake also missed half the season with an ankle injury. After the new coaching regime and management did not exercise his 5th-year option, Jacobs could be in his last year in the silver and black. Over the last three years, only Dalvin Cook has more red-zone rushing attempts than Jacobs so you're banking on 8+ rushing TDs on the ground. Consider him in the RB15-20 range which is a valuable asset in fantasy but the ceiling likely isn't much higher.",RB,6.747,2.474

Hall likely won't dominate all three downs but he has everything you want in his production profile. Overtaking the diminutive Carter on 3rd down is only a matter of time. We've seen at least two rookie RBs finish inside the top-24 each of the last seven years and Hall has the best shot to be part of that group in 2022. Consider him an RB2 with upside although the Jets offense will need to prove itself more competent than 28th in points per game for him to hit a ceiling outcome.",RB,7.0,2.878
54,Antonio Gibson,WAS,21,27,190.9,0.4444444444444444,5,"From Weeks 1-8, he was the RB19 in total points and the RB29 averaging only 10.9 fantasy points per game. However, the second half was a different story. From Week 10 on, he was the RB4. Some of this success was due to the absence of J.D. McKissic, who was concussed in Week 12 and did not return for the rest of the season. From that point on, Gibson saw five targets per game. Overall, he still tied with Joe Mixon for 2nd most 1st downs among all RBs. But the TDs were the major story. In 2020, he had a TD every 15 carries; in 2021, that regressed to every 37 carries. His floor seems high but the dreams of him being a top-5 guy are likely over. He's more of an RB2 moving forward when you also add in the wildcard that is Carson Wentz.",RB,7.07,3.142
55,Travis Etienne Jr.,JAX,22,25,187.4,0.5555555555555556,5,Etienne's Lisfranc injury was just the beginning of a forgettable season in Jacksonville. But now the slate can be wiped clean and all Urban Meyer-related thoughts can be cast aside. Remember this team spent 1st round draft capital on him and everything in his production and athletic profile states he could see 60+ receptions right away. He's settling in nicely as a 5th-round RB with upside to finish inside the top-15 if things break right.,RB,7.496,4.164
56,Cam Akers,LAR,23,24,183.6,0.6333333333333333,5,"Akers' Achilles injury and his recovery were one of the major fantasy storylines of 2022 especially after returning in the NFL playoffs. While the Rams win the Super Bowl, Akers was thrust into the lead role with mixed reviews. He averaged a porous 3.3 yards per touch and some of the burst we saw in his rookie year looked lost. With more than a year removed from the injury, Akers is getting hyped as a potential RB1 in fantasy this year. We aren't as bullish on his prospects tempering our expectations more in the low-end RB2 range. While 15+ touches a game seems fair to project, the efficiency might leave much to be desired.",RB,7.65,4.845

Through Week 8, the Cardinals were 7-1 as Edmonds was the RB20 averaging 14 opportunities per game including a healthy 4.6 targets. However, he was injured the next week and didn't return until Week 15. Now in Miami after signing one of the first free-agent deals of the off-season, he'll be in the mix with Raheem Mostert, Sony Michel, and Myles Gaskin. Edmonds profiles as the best fantasy option of the bunch given his receiving abilities but it's hard to envision more than FLEX territory for him.",RB,7.542,3.352
58,AJ Dillon,GB,25,24,180.1,0.25555555555555554,5,"Dillon started slowly behind Aaron Jones before becoming a viable RB2 the rest of the season. In Week 10, he was the RB1 on the week against Seattle showcasing what kind of potential he has in fantasy. He saw the same number of goal-line carries as Jones and worked in the passing game way more than you might have realized with 34 receptions, the same amount as Dalvin Cook. Dillon's weekly floor might be scary but the Packers might have to send both RBs out on the field together more often with a lack of dependable options in the passing game. Consider him an RB2 with massive upside with the added intimidation he brings to your squad with the best quads in the league.",RB,7.504,1.918
59,Clyde Edwards-Helaire,KC,26,23,179.1,0.4444444444444444,5,"We've come a long way since CEH was a top-5 redraft pick his rookie year. But it felt like it was the same refrain last year with some early excitement after two 100+ rushing yard games before suffering a knee injury and going on injured reserve. While he returned in Week 11, it always felt like Darrel Williams and Jerick McKinnon were the more trusted backs. Kansas City has the 2nd most vacated targets in the NFL where CEH could certainly benefit to see an uptick in passing work. He's a value but expecting anything more than low-end RB2 production might be wishful thinking.",RB,7.787,3.461
60,Rashaad Penny,SEA,27,23,178.7,0.5888888888888889,5,"For the first 12 weeks of the season, you probably forgot Penny was even in the league with 43 total rush yards as the (checks notes... scrolls... hold on... wait for it...) RB119. Heck, his brother Elijhaa Penny had more fantasy points as a full-back. But boy did things change... He ended up leading the league in yards per carry (6.3) and running for 700+ in his final six games. It was the stuff of fantasy legends and the Seahawks decided to bring him back on a one-year deal. He's a bruiser so his running style might not hold up over the course of a season. With Kenneth Walker III selected in the 2nd round, you're not expecting the same magic from Penny for long. But maybe he's the type of first-half RB2 your team needs at an affordable draft price.",RB,7.77,4.576
61,Elijah Mitchell,SF,28,22,174.0,0.41111111111111115,5,"Mitchell was one of our favorite dynasty sleepers last off-season but there was no way we'd imagine he would tie for the 2nd most 100-yard rushing games behind Jonathan Taylor. The Missle supplanted fellow rookie Trey Sermon very quickly seeing the most elite usage of any RB we've seen in the Kyle Shanahan system in San Francisco. From Week 10 through the NFL playoffs, he averaged 26 opportunities per game. However, there are some red flags as he missed three separate stints of the season due to injury woes. The 49ers also surprisingly selected RB Tyrion Davis-Price in the 3rd round to add to any already nauseous backfield rotation. He comes with a lot of risk but the lead dog in the 49ers backfield can be a valuable commodity. He's more of a low-end RB2 knowing Trey Lance brings the entire offense into question.",RB,7.909,3.251
62,Kareem Hunt,CLE,29,22,173.6,0.36666666666666664,5,"You might've forgotten but Hunt started out the year on fire scoring five TDs in his first five games. Before going down with an injury in Week 6, he averaged 87 total yards per game as the RB8 in fantasy. He tried to return from his ankle injury but it was a lost season for Hunt and the rest of the Browns. A lot has changed since with Deshaun Watson in town and now Hunt enters the final year of his contract. He'll always play second-fiddle to Nick Chubb in terms of usage. If there is another area of concern, it's the fact that during his last three full years as the Texans' starting QB, Watson targeted the RB position 14.7 percent of the time, dead last in the NFL. He'll need to overcome Chubb and Watson to truly be a fantasy force once again. He's a risk/reward RB in the 7th round.",RB,7.891,2.893
63,Miles Sanders,PHI,30,20,169.6,0.4222222222222222,6,"Sanders somehow failed to score one of the Eagles' league-leading 25 rushing TDs despite leading the team with 137 carries. For context, he's one of five different RBs with zero rushing TDs on that many attempts since 2010, the most recent Frank Gore. Not exactly great company. But we love this as a bounce-back spot on an offense that seems to be trending upwards. He ran for 5.5 yards per carry last season including two monster games (Week 13 & 15) where he simply didn't get in the end-zone. Fellow RB Boston Scott sees more goal-line work than you want and Kenneth Gainwell will mix in too. Still, Sanders can return RB2 value even with a league average TD amount (6+) based on his usage.",RB,8.48,3.58

As a rookie, nine percent of Dobbins’ rush attempts were 15+ Yards, the highest in the NFL. His insane TD rate might come down but the explosive runs were always part of his profile coming into the league. This offense should revert to being top-5 in rush rate in 2022 making Dobbins's current 4th round ADP a relative steal. He can add 25-30 receptions giving him a higher floor than most other backs in that range. It shouldn't shock you if he ends up as an RB1 this year.",RB,9.189,6.33

That end-of-season finish might be a bit inflated knowing there were so many injuries to other high-end RBs. Nevertheless, he feasted against AFC East opponents averaging 87 rushing yards and scoring eight times on the ground. Expect the elite TD total to come down with Rhamondre Stevenson taking over more of the workload and James White back in the mix.

He had over 1,000 total yards but still averaged just 35 percent of the snaps. Perhaps he will always be a fantasy tease, but it feels like we're ringing the same chorus we've sung the last two years: buy your lottery ticket but know you likely will be getting FLEX value at best as Zeke won't go away.",RB,9.662,3.543

From Week 15 through the playoffs, Singletary averaged 20+ touches per game including four straight RB1 finishes to finish the year.

Gordon surprisingly hung around all year as a capable RB2 on your roster finishing as the RB18, one spot behind backfield mate Javonte Williams. They had the same exact carries (203) and although things are trending for the talented Williams to take over, Gordon won't go away. He's a TD machine averaging double-digit TDs for the last six seasons and Russell Wilson should transform this offense to be even better in 2022.

The primary question marks here are if Jalen Hurts can take a step forward as a passer and Philadelphia’s offensive game plan. From Weeks 1-7 last year, they ranked 5th in neutral situation pass rate; from Week 8 on, they completely flipped the script from Week 8 on ranking 2nd in neutral situation rush rate.

We're not exactly excited about the upside of an offense run by a combination of Marcus Mariota and 3rd round rookie, Desmond Ridder.

He missed Weeks 13-17 during fantasy crunch time with a knee injury but is fully healthy to enter the season. While Waller is still one of few TEs can separate at the position, he's typically been a volume guy. Will he see that same volume with Davante Adams now on the roster?

We finally saw it last year when Ertz was shipped off to Arizona, and Goedert capitalized on his opportunity. His 830 receiving yards were a career high and ranked 5th among all TEs last season, and what's most impressive about this is that he's the only TE who saw less than 75 targets to eclipse 700 receiving yards a year ago. Not surprisingly, his 2.33 yards per route run was an elite metric and ranked #1 among all TEs. Goedert is a proven pass catcher, but the addition of A.J.

Knox's 2021 season is eerily similar to that of Robert Tonyan from 2020. Knox caught just 49 passes a season ago. Nine of them were for a TD, which is basically what led to his breakout season. To put this in perspective, Knox caught a TD pass on 18% of his receptions, which is highly unlikely to be repeated, even in the Bills high-powered offense.

It's encouraging how Pittsburgh used him last year. His nine targets inside the 10-zone tied for 2nd most at the position. The big stain on his 2022 outlook is playing with a rookie QB.

Tyler Conklin is in New York and while that may seem super appetizing for Irv's fantasy outlook, we need to remember that Kirk Cousins' TE hasn't seen a 15+% target share since Jordan Reed did it in 2015.

248,Adam Trautman,NO,29,1,77.9,0.41111111111111115,7,"Taysom Hill is reportedly being converted to a full-time TE, Michael Thomas is back and the team added Jarvis Landry via free agency and drafted Chris Olave in Round 1 of the NFL Draft. The Trautman dream was fun while it lasted.",TE,77.9,32.026
249,Daniel Bellinger,NYG,30,1,71.6,0.2777777777777778,7,"Who you may ask? Bellinger was a 4th round pick by the Giants with minimal production in college at San Diego State. However, he is huge (6'6"") and finds himself on a depth chart desperate for someone to be labeled as a starter. He could be streamable at some point if new HC Brian Daboll's offense clicks and Daniel Jones is somewhat competent. But for now, he's a name to monitor.",TE,71.6,19.889
250,Tommy Tremble,CAR,31,1,70.6,0.6111111111111112,7,"If you came here for something positive to say about Tommy Tremble from a fantasy perspective, you probably came to the wrong place. We're sure Tommy is a great guy, but for fantasy, he'll likely show up in the box scores every once in a while playing on this Panthers offense where the targets will be dominated by DJ Moore and Christian McCaffrey.",TE,70.6,43.144
251,Cameron Brate,TB,32,1,69.4,0.6333333333333333,8,"As it stands right now, Cameron Brate looks like a possible late-round target in fantasy after Rob Gronkowski announced his retirement. Being connected with Tom Brady is a beautiful thing but keep in mind in five total games without Gronk in 2021, Brate had seven combined receptions. He's a TD-or-bust kind of guy.",TE,69.4,43.953
252,Jonnu Smith,NE,33,1,67.3,0.5222222222222223,8,"Jonnu scored a huge free agent contract last year with New England, but that didn't translate to fantasy success. He saw just 45 targets in a run-heavy scheme. Pour one out for ya boy Jonnu's fantasy upside.",TE,67.3,35.146
253,C.J. Uzomah,NYJ,34,1,65.2,0.30000000000000004,8,"Uzomah had a mini-breakout last year with the Bengals en route to the Super Bowl, and that was kinda fun. But now he goes from Joe Burrow and the Bengals offense to a QB who wishes he was as cool as Joey B in Zach Wilson. Despite the team investing in Uzomah in free agency, we'd be shocked if he's fantasy relevant this year.",TE,65.2,19.56
254,Ricky Seals-Jones,NYG,35,1,64.3,0.5888888888888889,8,"Seals-Jones is now in New York as part of an ambiguous TE depth chart. We know Brian Daboll wants to throw the ball, but who is going to be the pass-catching TE for the G-men, and will it even matter? He's a name to monitor throughout the season as a potential streaming candidate. For the sake of our show and the entertainment we get out of Jason's seal noise, let's hope he earns some playing time.",TE,64.3,37.866
255,Greg Dulcich,DEN,36,1,63.4,0.30000000000000004,8,"Greg D! The mustached-man received day-2 draft capital and was one of the most productive Power 5 TEs in the country over the last two years, averaging 31.3% of his team’s receiving yards in 18 games. He now lands in a potentially high-powered offense led by Russell Wilson. While Albert Okwuegbunam is still on the roster, the camp buzz has placed this starting TE competition as up-in-the-air. He likely will have little fantasy relevance as a rookie but keep the name in mind... and the mustache.",TE,63.4,19.02
256,Trey McBride,ARI,37,1,54.3,0.5555555555555556,8,"He was a productive player in college with 90+ receptions at Colorado State last year. The Cardinals took him off the board in the 2nd round as the clear TE1 in this class. With Zach Ertz back, McBride probably won't be heard from during his rookie season.",TE,54.3,30.167
257,Will Dissly,SEA,38,1,44.4,0.5555555555555556,8,"Call us crazy, but we're not super into a TE who saw 26 targets a year ago whose now competing with pass catcher Noah Fant for playing time on an offense without Russell Wilson. For the sake of the show and the nickname, we'd love it if Big Montana came back.",TE,44.4,24.667
258,Jelani Woods,IND,39,1,38.3,0.6666666666666666,8,"Rookie TEs not named Kyle Pitts typically don't do much by way of fantasy production, especially rookie TEs selected in the 3rd round of the NFL Draft. He's not on our radar in redraft leagues, but he's a fun name to monitor for dynasty leagues.",TE,38.3,25.533
