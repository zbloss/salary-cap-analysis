He scored 67 more fantasy points last season than the WR2, Deebo Samuel. Prior to 2021, Kupp’s previous career-high in targets was 134. After seeing a league-leading 191 a season ago, it’s possible the target volume regresses just a little bit, especially with Allen Robinson now on the roster. Even so, his chemistry with Matthew Stafford and involvement around the goal line make Kupp a no-brainer pick in Round 1 of fantasy drafts.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Chase made his money on deep targets last season leading the NFL in 20+ yard targets a season ago while catching eight TDs on those deep targets, the most in football. It’s possible that efficiency regresses in 2022, but there’s plenty of room for Chase to take a step forward in the target department after seeing just 128 as a rookie. It’s scary to think what Chase could do with 140+ targets in year two…","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Adams joins a Raiders depth chart that includes Darren Waller and Hunter Renfrow, so the projectable 30+% target share may not be as secure as it was in years past, but Adams is still one of the NFL’s premier red zone targets, giving up double-digit TD upside every season. He’s logged 10+ TD in four of the last five years. The only time he didn’t? 2019 when he played just 12 games.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

After seeing a 27% target share a season ago and 165+ targets in each of his first two years in Buffalo, he’s a safe bet in fantasy who has the ceiling to finish as a top 5 option with Josh Allen under center.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He also scored a rushing TD for every 10 carries, a mark that is simply unsustainable. If these numbers regress in any way, it’s possible Samuel is being drafted at his absolute ceiling, especially when you bake in the unknown QB play from Trey Lance.

After all, you’re not going to be a top fantasy option if you only score 4 TDs, which is exactly what Moore has done each of the last three seasons. He has the 5th most targets & receiving yards for a WR before turning 25 in NFL history. With Baker Mayfield now as QB1, he could approach top-12 status if things break right in the TD category.

Higgins quietly had a fantastic role last year based on the underlying metrics. Even with Chase having a historic rookie season, Higgins still posted a 23.9% target share and ranked 10th at the position in yards per route run. In fact, Higgins had more total targets than Ja’Marr Chase following the team’s Week 10 bye. Because both wideouts will have big games, the consistency may not be there for Higgins. He should finish as a rock solid WR2 with spike weeks throughout the year.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Sutton was targeted 20+ yards downfield 29 times last season, 7th most in football. He caught just 9 of those passes, which helps illustrate some of the QB concerns from a year ago. Wilson has been one of football’s best deep passers over the last five years, and if Sutton is used similarly this year, we can certainly expect that catch rate to improve, giving Sutton a boost in efficiency and upside in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Brown has always been a player who’s thrived on efficiency as we’ve seen him have success in Tennessee’s low-volume passing offense. He’s ranked top-8 in yards per route run each of his three professional seasons. The primary question marks here are if Jalen Hurts can take a step forward as a passer and Philadelphia’s offensive game plan. From Weeks 1-7 last year, they ranked 5th in neutral situation pass rate; from Week 8 on, they completely flipped the script from Week 8 on ranking 2nd in neutral situation rush rate. If we see the pass attempts go up from Hurts, it would certainly elevate Brown’s fantasy ceiling in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

"George Pickens","PIT","9","91","$1","78.2","6.7","9","For 2022, we probably shouldn't expect too much given that he'll be competing with Diontae Johnson and Chase Claypool for targets. Of course, there are QB concerns as well with some combination of Kenny Pickett and Mitch Trubisky. He has the type of tools you want in a future WR1 but expecting anything more than being the 4th best option in this offense is probably wishful thinking.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Romeo Doubs","GB","14","92","$1","77.9","7.0","9","The 4th round rookie has received tons of camp buzz with Aaron Rodgers even recently praising his play on the practice field. Doubs had a productive final two years at Nevada and could be a solid outside receiver in this league. This is peak camp hype season so temper your expectations a bit considering Green Bay rookie WRs have never really produced for fantasy with Rodgers. He's a fun late stab in draft hoping you strike gold.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"David Bell","CLE","9","93","$1","77.9","6.0","9","Bell's range of outcomes in 2022 is pretty wide. A lot will depend on if Deshaun Watson gets to play all 17 games and if Bell can beat out Donovan Peoples-Jones as the WR2. He's been comped to a Jarvis Landry type, and ironically, Landry is no longer in Cleveland.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Olamide Zaccheaus","ATL","14","94","$1","77.6","5.3","9","If you haven't taken a look at the Falcons' depth chart, it's a real treat. We wouldn't recommend doing it while driving or bad things could happen. That depth chart includes Zaccheaus, who could be third in line for targets from ya boy Marcus Mariota. Let's be real, he's a replacement-level talent who is firmly behind Kyle Pitts and Drake London in the pecking order for one of (if not the) worst offense in football. Yucky.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Isaiah McKenzie","BUF","7","95","$1","77.4","7.0","9","McKenzie is a fun player to root for as he's been electric when given the opportunity in his career. He's a quick-twitch slot guy who blew up in Week 15 versus New England (11/125/1) in a spot start. With Cole Beasley gone, there is some healthy competition between McKenzie and veteran Jamison Crowder for the starting slot role. Buffalo ran 3-wide more than anyone in the league and the camp hype train is loud and constant for McKenzie to win the job. He's still mostly a late-round flier in PPR leagues.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Christian Watson","GB","14","96","$1","76.7","6.0","9","Davante Adams has averaged 153 targets per year over the last four seasons, opening up a massive hole on the depth chart. Can Christian Watson earn the trust of Aaron Rodgers as a rookie to help fill the void? We don't mind taking a flier later in drafts but realize that no rookie WR with Aaron Rodgers has ever seen more than 73 targets.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"N'Keal Harry","CHI","14","97","$1","73.9","5.7","9","Remember me? After being drafted with the final pick of the 1st Round in the 2019 NFL Draft, N’Keal Harry hasn’t been able to make any sort of impact. Bill Belichick identified the Patriots’ weaknesses and decided it was Harry that needed to go. Chicago might be even worse as the Justin Fields-led offense projects to be a low volume team. He'll have to fight off Byron Pringle and 3rd round pick Velus Jones Jr. to have any relevance. That doesn't sound like a tall order but then again, this is N'Keal Harry we're talking about...","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"
"Byron Pringle","CHI","14","98","$1","73.6","7.3","9","Well, someone has to operate as the Bears WR2 this year, right?

"Deonte Harty","NO","14","99","$1","71.6","4.0","9","Harty is a name you might've forgotten but he pops in a number of metrics we care about for fantasy. He was targeted on 26.9 percent of his routes (7th best among WRs) and an insane 2.69 yards per route run (5th best). With the additions of rookie Chris Olave and veteran Jarvis Landry, he might be squeezed into a part-time role in 2022. Nevertheless, he could find his way into fantasy relevance again if another WR goes down ahead of him.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Good times. Only four NFL WRs carry a bigger cap hit than Agholor in 2022. Unless the Patriots decide to let Mac Jones throw the ball more this year, they’re paying Agholor a ton of money to block his butt off.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He will probably contribute on special teams to open the year but could find his way onto the field as a field stretcher as the year goes on. Nevertheless, this is a low-volume passing offense and despite his tantalizing speed, he's not on the redraft radar in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He gathered back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons at Kentucky and has made some plays in training camp down the field.

Sean McVay did spend the team’s first draft pick (2nd round, 57th overall) in 2021 on Atwell and compared him to DeSean Jackson.
