"Josh Allen","BUF","7","1","$43","378.4","1.0","1","The Stallion was the first QB with back-to-back seasons as THE fantasy QB1 since Drew Brees accomplished the feat more than a decade ago. How good was he? Allen had five #1 overall weekly finishes, that’s more than Herbert, Brady, Mahomes, Rodgers, Stafford, and Dak… combined. While his six rushing TDs were the lowest of his career, his dual-threat ability and the fact he always has week-winning upside makes him bullet-proof in both dynasty and redraft leagues moving forward. Allen struggled at home comparatively completing just 59.8 % of his passes and averaging 6.1 yards per attempt, the same number Zach Wilson averaged on the year. The guys seem to be in agreement that he should be drafted as the QB1 in 2022, especially with this sustained level of excellence.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Here are the players to throw for 5,000+ in a season before turning 24: Patrick Mahomes, Dan Marino, Matthew Stafford, & Herbert. The offensive line was massively improved and HC Brandon Staley is everything we want choosing aggressiveness on 4th down instead of simply punting things away.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

"Kyler Murray","ARI","13","3","$29","350.0","4.3","2","In 2021, Kyler started out hot as the Cardinals began the season 7-0 and he looked like a legit MVP candidate. He was the QB4 for fantasy through that span. However, the season turned on a dime, especially with Kyler missing three games and the season-ending injury to All-Pro WR DeAndre Hopkins. He was effective throwing the deep ball, tying Tom Brady for most 20+ yard completions (35), and completing a league-leading 49.3 of those attempts. He improved his overall completion rate, TD rate, yards per attempt, and passing yards per game but dropped to fewer than FIVE rushing attempts per game. If Kyler doesn’t run, his fantasy ceiling ultimately is capped. Heading into 2022, the Cardinals have a ton of question marks with Hopkins’ suspension so he might fall to a spot in your drafts where the value is there.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

If you include his four starts in 2020, that number jumps to 8.82. For context, through his 49 career starts, Lamar Jackson is at 8.6. With the arrival of A.J.

Before then, he was on fire to start the year as the QB1 through Week 7 including 25+ fantasy points in five of his first six starts. The Chiefs’ defensive improvement was a big part of the story as KC allowed only 16.1 points per game from Week 8 on. He still was a QB1 each of the final five weeks of the season.

He’s been a QB1 for fantasy every year of his career before last season’s injury. He’s an efficiency monster with a career TD rate of 6.2 percent. 35 passing TDs and 300+ rushing yards feel well within range even at this stage of his career.

To put those numbers in perspective, Tom Brady never had more than one game in a season hitting 400 & 4. Burrow did it in back-to-back games. In just his 2nd year in the league, he led the NFL in completion % (70.4), Yards per Pass Attempt (8.9) & 20+ Yard TDs (13). If there were any red flags, it’s the fact he led the NFL in sacks taken (51) including five games of 5+ sacks taken, most in a season over the last decade. He also bullied bottom-16 defenses with the largest split of fantasy points  (11.28) among top-10 QBs. While a TD rate more than doubling (3.2 to 6.5) usually is a sign of regression, he might be an outlier. His upside is immense as 5,000 passing yards & 40 TDs aren’t out of the question.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Including this year's draft class, Lance would still be the youngest starting QB in the league at 22 years old. We only saw him in two brief starts but he managed to run the ball 24 combined times for 120 rushing yards which just shows you the type of upside you're looking for. He's worth a look as a late-round QB knowing you can pivot if things turn out horribly wrong with him under center. The reward outweighs the risk at his current ADP.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

He hit a lull from Weeks 13-15 but finished strong in the final three weeks:  QB2, QB5, and QB1. He’s one of the safest QBs in fantasy and the Dallas offense (with OC Kellen Moore) is going to flow through the arm of Dak. If he runs for 200+ and scores 4-5 on the ground, Dak could enter the elite tier again in 2022.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+. Get the UDK+.","Mark Drafted                      Mark Keeper"

Nevertheless, he led the league in games of 3+ TD passes (9) and his ten top-12 performances were the same as Aaron Rodgers. The frustrating part was the turnovers. He joins Drew Brees (2012) as the only QBs in NFL history to throw for 40+ TDs & lead the league in INTs. He also led the league with four pick-sixes. Stafford will likely be drafted among the top-8 QBs for 2022; with Cooper Kupp in tow and Allen Robinson’s arrival, he should have more options inside the red zone.","Unlock with the 2022 UDK+.

Not bad when you consider how the Packers started the year getting annihilated against the Saints in Week 1. Two TDs were in the bank almost every single week as Rodgers had two or more passing TDs in 15 of his 17 starts. There are obviously lots of questions heading in 2022 with Davante Adams’ departure.

It’s a definite boom for Carr’s upside but it must be tempered knowing he’s never finished a season as a top-12 fantasy QB. Even with 4,800+ passing yards and finishing 2nd among all QBs in 20+ yard pass plays last season, his lack of rushing yards ultimately hurts him from hanging with the elites for fantasy. The Raiders also were quite fortunate in 2021 going 10-7 despite having a win expectation of just 6.9. In the ultra-competitive AFC West, things only might get tougher in 2022.

More than anything, we know that former Giants GM Dave Gettleman reached for Jones at 6th overall in the 2019 draft and the Giants look like they’re moving on not picking up his 5th-year option.

Unfortunately, we’ve seen relatively few true boom games from Tua with only two top-8 weekly finishes in his first two years in the league. While the Dolphins had the 8th most pass attempts in the NFL, the lack of efficiency and averaging only 204 passing yards per game is not going to cut it.

The Patriots' game plan is winning with ball control and defense as Jones averaged only 223.6 passing yards per game finishing as a QB1 only five times.

In Washington, Wentz is now on his 3rd life with a new cast of pass-catchers. One drive he can look like an All-Pro and the next you’re wondering if maybe he knows which sport he’s playing out there.
